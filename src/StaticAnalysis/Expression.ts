// To analyze expressions, we will implement a *type inference* algorithm which
// will not only tell us whether an expression is well-typed, but in the
// success case will also tell us what the expression's actual type is.

// Most real-world languages in 2022 support some degree of type inference, but
// most only support *partial* type inference, where the compiler or
// interpreter may only be able to infer types in specific restricted cases.

// Our toy language is still simple enough that we can easily pull off *total*
// type inference, where we can figure out the type of any arbitrary expression
// as long as we have a StaticProgramScope mapping from variable names to types.
